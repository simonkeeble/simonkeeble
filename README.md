- 🤓 I wrote my first computer programs on the Sinclair ZX81 in...1981! Since then I've run projects, lead teams, founded companies, written code in lots of different languages, worked with a plethera of OS's and queried more databases than I can count.
- 👀 These days I'm mostly focused on developing applications in JavaScript / React / Nodejs / PHP / Python.
- 🌱 I'm always learning and refreshing.
- 💞️ I’m happy to collaborate on new project ideas, fill a gap in your team, or even lead it.
- 📫 Want to talk to me? Sure... 
- 🤿 When I'm not in front of a computer I'm out scuba diving, paddleboarding, walking in the hills or listening to music (vinyl never died)
