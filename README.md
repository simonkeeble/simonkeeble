- 🤓 I wrote my first computer programs on the Sinclair ZX81 in...1981! Since then, I've run projects, lead teams, founded IT companies, written code in lots of different languages, worked in a plethera of OS's and queried more databases than I can count.
So, this is me, I’m @simonkeeble
- 👀 These days I'm mostly focussed on developing web applications in JavaScript (+ various frameworks) or a PHP environment...sometimes a little python.
- 🌱 Life is learning and I'm always learning something so lately I've been refreshing my C skills and doing some comparisons between Golang and Rust.
- 💞️ I’m happy to collaborate on new project ideas or fill a gap in your team, or even lead it.
- 📫 Want to talk to me? Let's start with an email..
